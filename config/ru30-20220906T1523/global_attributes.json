QA/QC measures have been run according to the IOOS Manual for Real-Time Quality Control of pH Observations and IOOS Manual of Glider Data. Suspect/failed IOOS QC values, and values flagged by a CTD hysteresis test have been removed from this dataset (QC code: https://github.com/rucool/rugliderqc). CTD variables have been adjusted for thermal lag. pH and dissolved oxygen variables have been adjusted for sensor lag by applying optimal time shifts calculated by glider segment in order to minimize separation between glider down and upcasts as described in Saba et al 2019 https://doi.org/10.3389/fmars.2019.00664 and Wright-Fairbanks et al 2020 https://doi.org/10.1029/2020JC016505.

	"summary" : "This project is conducting seasonal deployments to investigate carbonate chemistry and monitor ocean acidification in the Mid-Atlantic Bight. The glider used for the automated observation includes an integrated deep rated version of the Ion Sensitive Field Effect Transistor (ISFET)-based pH sensor. The pH sensor unit is complemented with existing glider sensors including a CTD, a WETLabs FLBBCD ECO puck configured for simultaneous chlorophyll fluorescence and optical backscatter measurements, and an Acoustic Zooplankton Fish Profiler (AZFP) multi-frequency echo sounder for active acoustic detection of pelagic organisms. This deployment out of Sandy Hook, NJ ran cross-shelf transects zig-zagging southward and ultimately coming back inshore along E line for a recovery out of Tuckerton, NJ. This glider track covered Atlantic sea scallop and Atlantic surfclam habitats in the MAB. This delayed mode dataset contains CTD, chlorophyll a, CDOM and optical backscatter measurements, and post-processed pH data. The AZFP dataset is processed separately and not included here (to access this dataset, please email saba@marine.rutgers.edu). This is the second glider deployment in 2022 for this project. Delayed mode dataset. This deployment was ended early due to the slowly-flying glider that would not have enough battery to complete the mission.",
